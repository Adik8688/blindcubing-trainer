# Blindcubing trainer
## What's this
Blindcubing trainer is a simple and powerful tool for timing execution time for algorithms. It allows user to practice chosen subset of algorithms, calculate statistics and monitor the progress.

## Installation
Create python venv and install modules from `requirements.txt`

## How to start
First step is to load `excel file` with blind algorithms into the app. Go `Update comms` -> `Update algs` and choose proper spreadsheet. In addition spreadsheets with words or LPs can be loaded. If only algs are provided pair of target will be displayed in the screen. Otherwise words/LPs are used

## Play 
When first spreadsheet is loaded the app allows user to pick piece type (e.g. edges, corners), buffer and subset to be practiced.

## Stats
When some results have been saved it is possible to generate excel file with few statistics about every case with at least 1 result.
